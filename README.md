# Multiple Linear Regression Project
Inferential statistical learning project focused on studying the relationship between 4-year adjusted cohort high school graduation rates (ACGR) by school district and instructional expenditures per student, as well as other predictors such as median income, rural/urban status, student teacher ratio, ethnicity, percentage of students receiving reduced or free lunch, and other demographic variables. All work is done in the R statistical programming language.
