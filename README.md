# Project Description
Inferential statistical learning project focused on studying the relationship between 4-year adjusted cohort high school graduation rates (ACGR) by school district and instructional expenditures per student, as well as other predictors such as median income, rural/urban status, student teacher ratio, ethnicity, percentage of students receiving reduced or free lunch, and other demographic variables. All work is done in the R statistical programming language.

# Thesis statement
In the matter of 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rates (ACGR) of public U.S. high school districts, lower instructional expenditures per student may lead to higher graduation rates. Lower instructional expenditures would require schools to be innovative with their curricula in ways that promote student achievement and require schools to employ teachers who are willing to get paid lower salaries.
