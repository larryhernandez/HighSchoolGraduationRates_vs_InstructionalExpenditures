# Project Description
Inferential statistical learning project focused on studying the relationship between 4-year adjusted cohort high school graduation rates (ACGR) by school district and instructional expenditures per student, as well as other predictors such as median income, rural/urban status, student teacher ratio, ethnicity, percentage of students receiving reduced or free lunch, and other demographic variables. All work is done in the R statistical programming language.

# Thesis Statement
Lower instructional expenditures per student may lead to higher 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rates (ACGR) in U.S. public high school districts. Lower instructional expenditures would require schools to be innovative with their curricula in ways that promote student achievement and also require schools to employ the kind of teachers who are willing to get paid lower salaries.
