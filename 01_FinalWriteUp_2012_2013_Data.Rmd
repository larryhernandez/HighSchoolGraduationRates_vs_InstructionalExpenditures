## Introduction
  With the national public high school 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) in the United States residing at 81.4% $^{\dag}$, with the lowest rate of 71.7% held by Georgia and the highest rate of 89.7% claimed by Iowa, it is no surprise that many people would like to direct more money into the public education system. After all, it is commonly thought that more money in schools will translate into increased student achievement, and in particular more graduates. Educational expenses that are often targeted by this frame of thought include instructional supplies, instructional services, and teacher compensation, collectively known as instructional expenditures.  
    
  But does increased spending on instruction lead to higher 4-year public high school graduation rates? Some would argue yes. Instructional supplies and services are extremely important to student learning since they are part of the foundation of classroom education. More money for supplies and services would ensure that all students are set up for a successful learning experience. And perhaps paying teachers higher wages-or simply giving them annual bonuses for yielding higher standardized test scores-will increase their effectiveness as educators. A higher paid teacher could focus more on her curriculum instead of working a second, part-time job to make ends meet. While this theory seems plausible, the contrary theory seems reasonable too and is the hypothesis of this paper. Lower instructional expenditures per student may actually lead to higher 4-year ACGRs in U.S. public high school districts, because lower instructional expenditures would require schools to be innovative with their curricula in ways that promote student achievement and also require schools to employ the types of teachers who are willing to get paid lower salaries.

## Methods
  In this investigation, we study the relationship between 4-year ACGR and instructional expenditures per student in public high school districts across forty eight of the fifty states, including the District of COlumbia. We take into account demographic and financial variables related to education systems, including racial composition of a school, percentage of students identified as English language learners, and percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch. Using a multiple linear regression analysis, we examine the hypothesis that low instructional expenditures per student lead to higher 4-year ACGR in US public high schools.  
  
### Data Sources
  Data used in this study was obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the U.S. Department of Education EDFacts Initiative (EDFacts) websites. All data reflect the 2012-2013 school year for school districts residing in the United States, including the District of Columbia, and are indexed with a unique Local Education Agency Identification (LEAID) number. URLs are provided in the Appendix at the end of this document.

  Since it is common for some students to change school districts throughout their high school experience, the 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) is the version of high school graduation rate that is studied in this investigation. The ACGR accounts for student mobility, including transfers, emigration, and death during the 4-year academic period. ACGR is considered to be an accurate estimate of 4-year graduation rates. These data are found on the EdFacts website.
    
  The primary predictor of interest in this investigation is Instructional Expenditure per Student. Instructional expenditures include costs for instructional supplies, instructional services, and teacher salaries and benefits. The data for this variable is provided by the Elementary / Secondary Information System (ElSi) tableGenerator tool on the National Center for Education Statistics website.
    
  Other variables that are included in this investigation are: Urban Centric Locale; student-teacher ratio; number of students classified as English Language Learners (ELL); numbers of Hispanic, Asian / Pacific Islander, White, Black, and First Nations students; total student enrollment; and number of students eligible for free or reduced lunch, by school district. Urban Centric Locale indicates if a school district resides in a city (small, medium, or large), a suburb, a town, or rural area. Eligibility for reduced or free lunch is utilized as a proxy for poverty. These data are found on the NCES website using the Elsi tableGenerator.
        
  It should be noted that the Idaho state education agency was not required to calculate or report the new four-year ACGR for academic year 2012-13. Therefore, data corresponding to districts residing in Idaho were not available and, consequently, those districts were excluded from this study.
  
### Data Cleaning
  The aforementioned data were cleaned and transformed for analysis. Some ACGR data were provided in the form of a range, such as 60-69, or were anonymized using an alpha-numeric code, such as "GT50", which represents a value "greater than 50 percent". Any records with ACGR values reported as a numerical range exceeding 5 (percent) were excluded in order to minimize the impact of these data on the final model. Since 70% of the ACGR values were reported as a specific numeric values or within a 5 percent range, most of the original data were included in this model. The counts for each racial group were transformed to represent percentages of the student body, as were the counts for English Language Learners, and the counts for students in the reduced lunch program.
        
  Only districts containing all of the desired predictors were included in the final analysis. Since the Alabama education agency did not report statistics on the number of English Language Learners for any of its school districts, all school districts residing in Alabama were incidentally omitted from this study.
    
### Statistical Techniques
  A generalized additive (GAM) regression model was fit to the ACGR data while controlling for student-teacher ratio, percentage of students receiving for free or reduced lunch, percentage of English Language Learners, percentage of students from non-White, non-Asian racial backgrounds, and urban centric locale:
    
  The GAM model was chosen since these types of models are capable of independently modeling variables of interest, including nonlinear behavior, are capable of capturing interaction terms, and are well-suited for interpretation, the primary goal of this work. The specific predictors chosen here were readily available and some have suspected to be related to high school graduation rates. The model was fit on a 50% sample of the data set, validated using a distinct subset comprising 25% of the total available data, and finally tested for accuracy using the remaining 25% of the data. To test the model against perturbation, it was fit on California data and used to predict wisconsin ACGR.
    
#  A nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 iterations was performed to estimate the coefficient for Instructional Expenditures per Student and the intercept term. This same bootstrap was used to obtain estimates for the standard deviations of these coefficients. The nonparametric version was utilized since the true underlying relationship between the predictors and outcome are likely not linear.
